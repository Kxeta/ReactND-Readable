# Readable API Server

This is the project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where was built a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments that they own.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that is used to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.

## Start

To get started right away:

- Install and start the API server
  - `cd api-server`
  - `npm install`
  - `node server`
- In another terminal window, Install and start the front-end
  - `cd frontend`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`
